### Nice to meet you, I'm Josh!

I'm a research scientist, theoretical physicist, and data-phile. Since completing my Ph.D in physics in 2017, I've worked in universities around the world to understand deep questions in fundamental physics, including questions in:
* **Cosmology**: What was the universe like shortly after its birth at the Big Bang?
* **Astrophysics**: What is our galaxy made of, how does it interact, and how do we know?
* **Particle physics phenomenology**: How can we discover *dark matter* by conducting sensitive experiments on (or near) the Earth?

If you're interested in my work on fundamental physics, you may want to check out my profile on [Inspire-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1497168?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true) or on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=_VcEY4wAAAAJ).

Beyond these large-scale questions, I'm interested in how to use data to tell a story: how do we uncover the secrets within large data sets to figure out what is true about the world? We can ask this question in medicine, law, industry, economics, finance, and just about everywhere else. The tools of data science are so widely applicable and, in today's age of machine learning and AI revolution, only becoming more powerful!

With this in mind, I've decided to move back to the US and shift my focus in a more data-driven direction, using the talents I've picked up over the past decade to a more pragmatic purpose. In the coming months and years, I will expand this profile with repositories on a wide range of topics, hoping to share the resulting insights with the world.
